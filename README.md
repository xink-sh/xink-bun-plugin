# xink-bun-plugin

A bun plugin for the Xink API router; in early development. The current API may change, or this plugin may be abandoned.

The hope of a plugin is that it will enable developers to run Xink in edge runtimes that don't have access to filesystem APIs.

## Current Limitations

- only tested with Ubuntu on Windows WSL
- only supports typescript files
- there is no published package, so you'd need to clone this repo and use `bun link` to add it to your test api

## Route Types

Largely based on [Medley Router](https://github.com/medleyjs/router), Xink router supports the following:

  - static: /hello/there/world
  - dynamic: /hello/[name]
  - specific: /hello/miss-[name]
  
  - trailing rest: /hello/[...rest]
  - matcher: /hello/[name=string] (where 'string' references a function which tests if [name] matches)

> The [[optional]] route feature is planned. We may consider allowing [...rest] to be in the middle of a route.

## Setup

I still need to experiment with just using bun as a dev dependency - if that's even possible for this use-case. For now, I've globally installed bun.

There will eventually be a one-liner that helps do the below three steps for you. These three files should be created in the root of your project.

1. A bun.build.ts file.
    ```ts
    import { xink } from "@xink-sh/xink-bun-plugin"

    await Bun.build({
      entrypoints: ['./index.ts'],
      outdir: 'out',
      plugins: [xink()]
    })
    ```
2. A bun.plugin.ts file.
    ```ts
    import { plugin } from "bun"
    import { xink } from "@xink-sh/xink-bun-plugin"

    await plugin(xink())
    ```
3. A bunfig.toml file. This is needed for running the server during `bun run dev`.
    ```toml
    preload = ["./bun.plugin.ts"]
    ```
4. In your package.json file, create these scripts.
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "bun --watch index.ts",
      "build": "bun bun.build.ts"
    }
    ```

## Create Routes

By default, routes should be created in `src/routes`. Each folder under this path represents a route segment.

At the end of a route segment, a `route.ts` file should export one or more functions for each HTTP method it will serve. You can also define a `fallback`, for any unhandled request methods.

Xink supports these verbs and function names: 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE', 'HEAD', 'OPTIONS', 'fallback'

```ts
/* src/routes/article/[slug]/endpoint.ts */
import { json, text, type RequestEvent } from '@xink-sh/xink-bun-plugin'

export const GET = async ({ params }: RequestEvent) => {
  const article = await getArticle(params.slug)

  return text(`Here is the ${article.title} post!`)
}

export const POST = async ({ req }: RequestEvent) => {
  return json(await req.json())
}

export const fallback = ({ req }: RequestEvent) => {
  return text(`Hello ${req.method}`)
}
```

## Use

In your project root, create an `index.ts` file that uses the xink plugin.

```ts
/* index.ts */
import { Xink } from "@xink-sh/xink-bun-plugin"

const api = new Xink()

Bun.serve({
  fetch(req) {
    return api.fetch(req)
  }
})
```

## Parameter Matchers

You can validate route params by creating ts files in `src/params`. The file needs to export a `match` function that takes in a string and returns a boolean. When `true` is returned, the param matches and the router either continues to try and match the rest of the route or returns the route if this is the last segment. Returning `false` indicates the param does not match, and the router keeps searching for a route.

```ts
/* src/params/fruit.ts */
export const match = (param: string) => {
  const fruits = new Set(['apple', 'orange', 'grape'])
  return fruits.has(param)
} 
```

The above would be used in your route segment like so: `/src/routes/[fruits=fruit]`, where the right-side name should equal the filename (minus the extension) in `src/params`.

Xink provides the following built-in matchers, but they can be overridden by creating your own file definitions:

```ts
/* string */
(param) => /^[a-zA-Z]+$/.test(param)
```
```ts
/* number */
(param) => /^[0-9]+$/.test(param)
```

## Helper Functions

### html
Returns an html response. It sends a `Content-Length` header and a `Content-Type` header of `text/html`.
```ts
import { html } from "@xink-sh/xink-bun-plugin"

export const GET = (event) => { 
  return html(`<div>You chose ${event.params.fruit}</div>`)
}
```

### text
Returns a text response. By default, it sends a `Content-Length` header and a `Content-Type` header of `text/plain`.
```ts
import { text } from '@xink-sh/xink'

export const GET = () => {
  return text(`Hello World!`)
}
```

### json
Returns a json response. By default, it sends a `Content-Length` header and a `Content-Type` header of `application/json`.
```ts
import { json } from '@xink-sh/xink'

export const GET = () => {
  return json({ hello: world })
}
```

## Plugin Configuration

Right now, there are only two configurable items. Because of the current Bun plugin system, and needing to use the plugin during development and buildtime, this configuration is needed in both `bunfig.toml` and `bun.build.ts`.

```ts
type XinkConfig = {
  params?: string; // path where param matchers are defined.
  routes?: string; // path where routes are defined.
}

xink({
  params: 'src/params',
  routes: 'src/routes'
}: XinkConfig)
```

## Types

```ts
type RequestEvent = {
  headers: Omit<Headers, 'toJSON' | 'count' | 'getAll'>;
  locals: { [key: string]: string },
  params: Params;
  request: Request;
  url: Omit<URL, 'createObjectURL' | 'revokeObjectURL' | 'canParse'>;
}
```

## Origins
Pronounced "zinc", the name is based on the Georgian word [khinkali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khinkali); which is a type of dumpling in the country of Georgia. The transcription is /Ëˆxink'ali/. To be clear: khinkali's beginning proununciation is dissimilar from "zinc".
